I'm a junior studying CS at the University at Buffalo with a interest in AI and full-stack development. Experienced in building machine learning workflows, multi-agent applications, and mobile apps that combine data and usability. Passionate about building tools that have impact.
Outside of tech, Iâ€™m 6â€™5 â€” just as good at debugging code as I am at grabbing things off the top shelf. When im not coding, you can usually find me playing volleyball, watching F1 every weekend, and always listening to music!
